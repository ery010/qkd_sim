# How to Securely Deploy Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
## University of California Davis
Simulator that emulates QKD transmissions over classical and quantum channel for key generation.
Simulator provides implementations of strategies that mitigate and monitor eavedropping during QKD including SDN, Poly1305-AES, and Cascade Protocol based information reconciliation.
Most updated verision of simulator codebase is in notebooks/qkddash_2
